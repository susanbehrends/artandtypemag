    <h1>All about us!</h1>
    <p>
      Art and Type Magazine was born out of the pandemic and was first launched
      online in the summer of 2020. Faced with the uncertainty of the time, two
      art school first-years with shared creative passions founded this zine as
      a way to bring together artists from across the globe by publishing their
      work. Through a series of open calls, submission reviews, Zoom and email
      interviews, and countless hours of design and production, Art and Type has
      published the work of over 100 artists and writers via five issues.

    <h2>What we do</h2>
    <p>
      We aim to not only support the work of our contributors by helping expand
      their reach, but also support the work of local art organizations. The
      proceeds from our issues are donated to organizations chosen by the
      contributors. Issue three for example, raised $550 for <a href="https://www.girlsclub.org">Lower Eastside
        Girls Club</a> in Manhattan and <a href="https://www.dinecollege.edu" >Diné College</a> in Tsaile, Arizona. These
      organizations directly relate to the themes of this issue, which revolves
      around craft arts and care.
    </p>
    <h2>How to get involved</h2>
    <p>
      Submit your art or writing to our biannual open calls! We tend to keep our
      themes broad to accommodate a breadth of mediums, narratives and
      perspectives. We welcome work from anyone — no matter your background,
      experience, or age — and never charge a submission fee. Stay tuned on our 
      <a href="https://www.instagram.com/artandtypemag/">Instagram</a> page or <a href="https://mailchi.mp/c3100741f6d7/artandtype">Subscribe</a> to our mailing list to find out when we are

    <h1>Submission FAQs</h1>
    <h2><em you accept submissions in x medium?></h2>
    <p>
      Unless otherwise stated in the submission form, all mediums are welcome! For video works, please submit a link to the video and a selection of stills.
    </p>
    <h2>When will I find out about my submission results?</h2>
    <p>Due to the volume of submissions we receive for each open call, it may take us up to 5 weeks to review each submission and come to a final decision. All applicants will be notified of their final results within this time frame.</p>
    <h2>Is this a paid opportunity?</h2>
    <p>Since we receive no outside funding, are an ad-free publication, and typically feature up to 30 contributors per issue, our proceeds are too limited to be able to pay each artist. Instead, we donate the funds to an organization agreed upon by the contributors. Contributors may purchase a copy of the issue for the price it costs to print it, with no additional fee.</p>
